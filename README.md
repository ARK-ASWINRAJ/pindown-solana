# Solana PinDown Project

### **About Pindown **

PinDown is a simple document certifier. It records the document transfer data and link details on-chain such that only the issuer can specify the link to the document and receiver address and the source(issuer public key) is signed by the issuer.

### **How to get started **

1. Run `npm install` at the root of your directory
2. Run `npm run start` to start the project
